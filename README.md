njbair's dotfiles
=================

What are dotfiles? [Read this](http://dotfiles.github.com/).

Since I started using GitHub for dotfiles management, I have lost
300lbs, won the lottery twice, and developed a regenerative healing
factor. It's also much easier to customize shell logins now, but I
primarily did it for the healing factor.

My name is Nick Bair and you can find me at
